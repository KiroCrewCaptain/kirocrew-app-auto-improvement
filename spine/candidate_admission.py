"""Opt-in project evidence check that both keep paths consult before committing a candidate.

``candidateAdmissionCommand`` in the app config names the checker as an argv list whose
first element is an absolute path. It runs in the same sandbox as the target repository's
tests, reads one JSON request on stdin, and admits the candidate only by printing a JSON
object whose ``request_sha256`` is the SHA-256 of the exact request bytes and whose
``status`` is ``"admitted"``. Anything else refuses the keep. Unset, nothing changes.
